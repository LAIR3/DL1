# Python Deployment Script for Blockchain Services Using Starlark

## Overview

This script provides a structured approach to deploying and managing a blockchain's essential components, including bridge services, aggregation layers, and user interfaces. It demonstrates the integration of Python code with Starlark configuration files in a real-world application, leveraging dynamic configuration generation and service orchestration.

## Key Components

The script interacts with several modular components imported as Starlark files:
- **`service_package`**: Manages generic service-related functionalities.
- **`zkevm_agglayer_package`**: Specific to the configuration and operational management of the zkEVM aggregation layer.
- **`zkevm_bridge_package`**: Focuses on the configuration and management of bridge services connecting different blockchain layers.

## Primary Functions and Workflow

### `run(plan, args)`

#### Description
This is the main function that orchestrates the setup and deployment of blockchain services. It manages the configuration artifacts, service files, and initiates service startups.

#### Parameters
- `plan`: An object representing the deployment plan, capable of managing services and their configurations.
- `args`: A dictionary of arguments that define specific configuration values such as service names, ports, and paths.

#### Process Flow
1. **Retrieve Contract Setup Addresses**: Obtains blockchain contract addresses necessary for service configurations.
2. **Configure Bridge Services**:
   - Generates and stores configuration and keystore files for bridge services.
   - Deploys the bridge services using configurations derived from the templates and stored keystore.
3. **Configure Aggregation Layer Services**:
   - Similar to bridge services, it configures and deploys aggregation services.
4. **User Interface and Proxy Setup**:
   - Deploys user interface services and configures reverse proxies to manage traffic between services.

### Helper Functions
- **`create_*_config_artifact(plan, args, contract_setup_addresses)`**: These functions generate configuration artifacts for bridge, aggregation layer, and UI services using predefined templates and dynamic data.
- **`store_service_files(plan, name, service_name, src)`**: Handles the storage of service-specific files like keystores.

## Configuration and Templates

Each service (bridge, agglayer, UI) has corresponding TOML or environment variable configuration templates. These are populated with actual runtime data and stored as artifacts which are then used to configure services during deployment.

## Service Deployment and Management

Deployed services are managed through a plan object that facilitates adding services with specific configurations, handling dependencies, and ensuring that the network setup aligns with the defined architecture.

## Security and Data Management

The script ensures sensitive data, such as keystore files and passwords, are handled securely through the management plan and only accessible within the service context that requires them.

## Usage

To execute this script within a deployment framework:
1. Ensure all prerequisites are met, including having access to the necessary service modules and configuration templates.
2. Pass the appropriate `plan` and `args` to the `run` function to start the deployment process.

## Conclusion

This script exemplifies how modular Python scripting combined with Starlark can effectively manage complex deployments in a blockchain environment, ensuring each component is correctly configured and launched according to the operational requirements.
